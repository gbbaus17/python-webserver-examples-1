# This workflow uses actions from examples on mslearn and from copilot example lookups
# We could explicitly specify the tools using a comma-separated list, like this
#     tools: bandit,binskim,checkov,eslint
# or we can leave tools unspecified and rely on defaults (as below)
#
# ps: For source‑code scanning (Python, JS, IaC), 
#     ubuntu-latest is the better default; windows-latest is only needed when you’re scanning Windows/.NET binaries.
